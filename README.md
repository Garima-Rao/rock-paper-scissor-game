# rock-paper-scissor-game
This Java program implements the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It is a simple console-based game designed for two players. The players, often a user and a computer opponent, can choose from three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Each choice has a specific outcome against the othersâ€”Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock.
